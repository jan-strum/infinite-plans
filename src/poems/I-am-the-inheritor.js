        Screaming the secrets of immobile life, I find him surviving his own
        expiration. He lets me order his time with my explanations and hold in
        solution his nearest name. Now I feel sick. I avoid speech at all costs,
        like the nothing-box, and those who are spacious in the possession of
        dirt. I knock my head against a wall and he trickles down. He passes me
        by, crawling to the cross reading “Martyr’s Provisions,” coming close to
        my rhetoric. We understand, then—do we not? Who knows? But I am enjoying
        this, and today it belongs to the cult of our relation and its
        preparatory silence.
