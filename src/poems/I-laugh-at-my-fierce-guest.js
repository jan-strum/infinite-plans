        I laugh at my fierce guest. He squints around modestly, as if on a
        stranger's property.

        He makes mouths at the invisible event, rattling with diction and dice.

      <p>
        But he is chained to my children, riddle-happy. And he tells them of the
        permanent war machine:
      </p>
      <p>the tremendous precision instrument of civilization.</p>
